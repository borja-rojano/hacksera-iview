              <p>The invention discloses a method to appraise chicken species with DNA encoding strip in molecular biology technical domain, which comprises the following steps: utilizing DNA test-sequence technology; checking gene sequence of the chicken group and standard control sample mitochondria cell coloring matter C oxidase I(cytochrome C oxidase I COI); proceeding chicken specie checking according to point of discontinuity of COI sequence, haploid type, haploid type multiple degree (Hd), nucleic acid multiple degree (Pi), genetic distance of double parametric model among species, nucleic acid branch degree among species, specific site of each specie and DNA classified image. This invention can reflect the difference among species compared to the other methods, which result can be scientific proof to appraise genuine-fake of chicken species.</p>
